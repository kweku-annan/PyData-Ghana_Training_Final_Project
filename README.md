# PyData-Ghana_Training_Final_Project
A repository containing projects requirements for the final project of the PyData-Ghana Data Science Bootcamp
## PART ONE

This part contains a jupyter notebook and a csv file that holds the final data of the work.

In this part of the project, I created something like a comparison portal for grannies who are interested in knitting.

The portal is suppose to display wool-knitting information from different websites. But in this case I used only one website (https://yarnplaza.com/).

Data (price, needle size, and composition) of the following brand materials were collected and stored in a csv file using Pandas.

1. DMC Natura XL
2. DROPS Safran
3. STYLECRAFT Special dk.

I used Selenium and Xpath to do the scraping.

The Python Programming Language was used.



## PART TWO

This part of the project contains a Jupyter Notebook and a csv file which is a dataset of COVID-19 data from Pennsylvania.

The focus of this project was to test my Data Process and Analysis skills.

I used the Python Pandas library to complete this project.

The project is focused on the following:

### 1. Overview of the dataset.
Here, I did the following:
1. Used pandas to show the general description of the dataset
2. Showed the number of duplicate entries in the dataset

### 2. COVID Information on 16th June, 2021.
Here, I worked on only one row of the dataset. That's information gathered on 16th June, 2021.
1. Get the state name
2. Get the day's date
3. Work out the cumulative confirmed or suspected cases
4. Work out the cumulative death that are suspected or confirmed
5. New cases
6. New cases
7. Ratio of population that has completed vaccination
8. Ratio of population that has initiated vaccination
9. 

Most of the information was available in the dataset so there was no need for much calculations.


Also I used seaborn to display the relationship between the confirmed cases and the ratio of people who have been vaccinated. I found out that 
there is a positive relationship between those who have been vaccinated and the number of confirmed cases
